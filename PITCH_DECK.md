## Slide 1: Cover
**Title:** Oman Address
**Tagline:** Bringing delivery to every home in Oman
**Your name & contact**

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

**In Oman, millions of people can't get deliveries at home.**

- 60%+ of homes have no street address
- Residents rely on P.O. boxes only
- Must drive to post office for every package
- Can't order food delivery
- E-commerce severely limited

**Real impact:**
- Lost economic opportunity
- Inconvenience for residents
- Barrier to digital economy growth

---

## Slide 3: Why This Matters Now

**Market drivers:**
- Oman Vision 2040: Digital transformation initiative
- Growing middle class and smartphone adoption
- E-commerce growing 25%+ annually in GCC
- Food delivery market expanding rapidly
- Last-mile delivery is the bottleneck

**The gap:** Infrastructure hasn't caught up with demand

---

## Slide 4: The Solution

**Oman Address: A digital addressing layer**

We create unique address codes for homes that lack traditional addresses.

**How it works:**
1. Resident registers home location (GPS + details)
2. Gets unique code (e.g., OM-MUS-4729A)
3. Uses code when ordering
4. Delivery partners use our API to navigate

**Result:** Every home becomes deliverable
