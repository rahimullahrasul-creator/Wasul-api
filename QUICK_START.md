## 📞 Common Questions

**Q: Can I use this in production right now?**
A: Yes! It's ready. Just deploy and start testing.

**Q: What if I don't know how to code?**
A: The code is done. Follow DEPLOYMENT.md - it's copy/paste.

**Q: How do I get my first customer?**
A: Start with someone you know. A local restaurant owner, friend who owns a shop, etc.

**Q: What about the chicken-and-egg problem?**
A: Focus on ONE neighborhood. Get 50-100 addresses, then approach restaurants in that area specifically.
